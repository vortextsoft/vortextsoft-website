      "content": "Let’s say we have four playing cards. Each card differs from the others. After shuffling all four cards, one person asks to take the queen from those cards. He will pick cards one by one until he gets the queen card. So, at some point, he will get the queen card. This is how classical computers work. Classical computers are the computers that we use in our day-to-day lives. But quantum computers can find the queen only in one attempt. Whatever the number of cards, even within a million cards, quantum computers can find the queen with only one try. This shows how powerful they are.",
